A Project I am working on with my team. We are trying to recreate a device like a smart watch with some inspiration from the game "Fall Out"

This device will be attach to the user arm and will be able to have functions like Air quality sensor, Heart rate monitor, Gps, Temperature/ humidity, Micro sd compadibility, and etc

We made this device not only to challenge us as Engineers, but to also have a device that could help worker that are in harsh environments. 

In this Project you will see the schemathic we use and the pcb layout of the device.
